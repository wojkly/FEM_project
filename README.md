# FEM_project
A program which solves a differential equation using FEM method and plots the results. 


The problem is describes on the first page of the report. Its a 2nd degree differential equation with boudnary conditions.

The following page contains convertion of the equation to its weak formulation.

Last pages contain the same code, which is available in the /code folder
